You need to have the following installed:
- python3.7
- python3-pip
- python3.7-venv

Create a virtualenv:

```python3.7 -m venv venv``` (Not sure if this is necesary - need to test if the venv in the repo can be used)

activate venv:

```source venv/bin/activate```

install combatLogAPI-module:

```pip install -e .```

install remaining requirements with pip:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```
